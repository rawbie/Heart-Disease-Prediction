# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and demographic data using machine learning classification models.

## 🎯 Goals
1. Develop a predictive model for heart disease diagnosis.
2. Identify key health indicators influencing heart disease risk.
3. Optimize and validate the model for clinical application.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- Features: Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, number of major vessels, thalassemia type.
- Target: Presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification).
